    <h3><em>The best chicken parmesan with a deliciously crispy coating, smothered in a rich homemade tomato sauce and
            melted mozzarella cheese!</em></h3>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oven baked Chicken Parmesan is simple to make and worth every minute! If you love a crispy crumb coating vs a
        soffy crumb, look no further! The best you will ever make! Chicken Parmesan
        is one of the most loved, most popular AND most ordered chicken recipes in the world. BUT often times, chicken
        comes out too dry, or doesn't have enough flavor or seasoning. The sauce is bland, or cheddar cheese is
        is used instead of mozzarella, etc.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Panko</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic (or onion)</li>
        <li>Homemade sauce or favorite marinara</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps/Directions</h2>
    <p>For The <em>Chicken</em>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven 430 Â°F. Lightly grease an oven tray (or baking dish) with non stick cooking oil spray; set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Add chicken into the egg, rotating
            to evenly coat each fillet in the mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to marinate for at least 15
            minutes (or overnight night if time allows for a deeper flavor).</li>
        <li>When chicken is ready for cooking, mix bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and garlic powder together in a
            separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into the breadcrumb mixture to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Fry chicken until golden and
            crispy, (about 4-5 minutes each side).</li>
        <li>Place chicken on prepared baking tray / dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of sauce (sauce recipe
            below). Top each chicken breast with 2-3 slices of mozzarella cheese and about 2 tablespoons parmesan
            cheese. Sprinkle with basil or parsley.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is bubbling and melted, and the chicken is completely cooked
            through.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For The <em>Sauce</em>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium-sized pot. Fry onion until transparent (about 3 minutes), then add the garlic until
            fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree, salt and pepper to taste, Italian herbs and sugar (If using). Cover with lid to simmer
            for about 8 minutes, or until sauce has thickened slightly. Taste test and adjust salt and pepper, if
            needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>NOTES</h4>
    <p>For this recipe, we use both chicken thighs and breasts. Serve with pasta, mashed potato, a salad, steamed
        veggies, zucchini noodles or cauliflower rice for the perfect meal.</p>
