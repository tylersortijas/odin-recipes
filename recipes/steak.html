    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven).
    This is one of our favorite steak recipes and we make it year-round because it's such a quick and convenient cooking method. 
    That garlic butter is lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to improve beef sustainability, reduce food waste and you will love our ideas for easy
    meal prep with leftover steak.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Well-marbled steaks will give you the juiciest results. Our favorite steaks to cook on a skillet are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New York Steak</li>
        <li>Top Sirloin Steak</li>
        <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Any oil of choice</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Pan Sear Steaks (Step by step)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a prefect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li><strong>Season generously</strong> - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> - on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear steaks</strong> - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li><strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> - melt in butter with quarted garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li><strong>Remove steak</strong> - and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> We prefer using a <em>large cast-iron pan</em> for best heat conduction, but a large heavy stainless steel pan will also work.</p>
